	"content": " Introduction Fastboot is a USB protocol for the host to communicate with the target android device at bootloader stage. Rockchip implements the fastboot protocol in u-boot, so ROCK960 use fastboot functionality.\nHow to go to fastboot mode There are 2 ways to go to fastboot mode\n In u-boot serial console, type fastboot command to go to fastboot mode In android shell, run adb reboot fastboot or reboot fastboot to reboot to fastboot mode. Note: adb reboot bootloader or adb reboot loader will reboot to Rockusb mode, not fastboot mode.  Fastboot host tools The fastboot host command can run on Windows/Linux/macOS. To check if the devices is in fastboot mode:\nfastboot -i 0x2207 devices  Supported fastboot commands Get info command fastboot getvar version #get the version fastboot getvar version-bootloader #get the bootloader version fastboot getvar unlocked #check if unlocked fastboot getvar secure #check if locked fastboot getvar product #get product name fastboot getvar serialno #get serial number fastboot getvar partition-type:\u0026lt;partition_name\u0026gt; #get partition type fastboot getvar partition-size:\u0026lt;partition_name\u0026gt; #get partition size fastboot getvar partition-offset:\u0026lt;partition_name\u0026gt; #get partition offset  Lock/Unlock command fastboot oem unlock fastboot oem unlock_accept (oem unlock_accept command must be input within 5 seconds after oem unlock command) fastboot lock #lock the devices  Write images command You must unlock the device first and then write images.\nfastboot flash \u0026lt;partition_name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;file_name\u0026gt; (For example, fastboot flash system system.img) (Note: the partition name for parameter/loader is \u0026quot;parameter\u0026quot;/\u0026quot;loader\u0026quot;)  Reboot command fastboot oem recovery #reboot to recovery fastboot oem recovery:wipe_data #reboot to factory reset fastboot reboot #just reboot fastboot reboot-bootloader #reboot to rockusb mode fastboot continue #normal boot  "
