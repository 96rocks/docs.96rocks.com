Note: adb reboot bootloader or adb reboot loader will reboot to Rockusb mode, not fastboot mode.  Fastboot host tools The fastboot host command can run on Windows/Linux/macOS. To check if the devices is in fastboot mode:\nfastboot -i 0x2207 devices  Supported fastboot commands Get info command fastboot getvar version #get the version fastboot getvar version-bootloader #get the bootloader version fastboot getvar unlocked #check if unlocked fastboot getvar secure #check if locked fastboot getvar product #get product name fastboot getvar serialno #get serial number fastboot getvar partition-type:\u0026lt;partition_name\u0026gt; #get partition type fastboot getvar partition-size:\u0026lt;partition_name\u0026gt; #get partition size fastboot getvar partition-offset:\u0026lt;partition_name\u0026gt; #get partition offset  Lock/Unlock command fastboot oem unlock fastboot oem unlock_accept (oem unlock_accept command must be input within 5 seconds after oem unlock command) fastboot lock #lock the devices  Write images command You must unlock the device first and then write images.\nfastboot flash \u0026lt;partition_name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;file_name\u0026gt; (For example, fastboot flash system system.img) (Note: the partition name for parameter/loader is \u0026quot;parameter\u0026quot;/\u0026quot;loader\u0026quot;)  Reboot command fastboot oem recovery #reboot to recovery fastboot oem recovery:wipe_data #reboot to factory reset fastboot reboot #just reboot fastboot reboot-bootloader #reboot to rockusb mode fastboot continue #normal boot  "

The master branch is the souce for the documents.\nHow to contribute Install hugo The documents is generated by Hugo, a static site generator.\nFor apt based Linux such as Debian or Ubuntu:\nsudo apt-get install hugo  For MacOS:\nbrew install hugo  Other platform please refer Hugo install documents.\nLocal preview Fork the repo and clone it\ngit clone --recurse https://github.com/96rocks/docs.96rocks.com.git cd docs.96rocks.com hugo server  The output is like below:\n... Serving pages from memory Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1) Press Ctrl+C to stop  Open your browser, go to http://localhost:1313/ and you can view the docs locally.\nPrepare the gh-pages branch We use git’s worktree feature to checkout the gh-pages branch at public folder(which hugo will generate all the html to). Essentially, the worktree allows you to have multiple branches of the same local repository to be checked out in different directories.\nRun\n./publish.sh cd public git branch  You should see the gh-pages branch.\nEdit/Add documents The documents are under content directory, starting with _index.en.md(with multiple language support). You can copy and paste the exsiting files to start new sections. Put all the images in one image directory. Hugo can auto refresh if there is any file changes. Commit and push the change to your repo if the preview is ok and send pull request from the master branch. We will merge it and update the gh-pages branch. Updating gh-pages branch is live instantly. Your contribution will be automatically added to the credit section once merged.\n"
