This documents is hosted on [Github Page](https://pages.github.com/) with custom domain at [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/96rocks/docs.96rocks.com/tree/gh-pages). The master branch is the souce for the documents.

# How to contribute

## Install hugo

The documents is generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator.

For apt based Linux such as Debian or Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install hugo

For MacOS:

    brew install hugo

Other platform please refer [Hugo install documents](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing).

## Local preview

    git clone --recurse https://github.com/96rocks/docs.96rocks.com.git

    Press Ctrl+C to stop

Open your browser, go to [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/) and you can view the docs locally.

## Prepare the gh-pages branch

We use gitâ€™s [worktree feature](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) to checkout the gh-pages branch at **public** folder(which hugo will generate all the html to). Essentially, the worktree allows you to have multiple branches of the same local repository to be checked out in different directories.

Run

	./publish.sh
	cd public
	git branch

You should see the **gh-pages** branch.

## Edit/Add documents

The documents are under **content** directory, starting with **_index.en.md**(with multiple language support). You can copy and paste the exsiting files to start new sections. Put all the images in one image directory. Hugo can auto refresh if there is any file changes. Commit and push the change to your repo if the preview is ok and send pull request from the master branch. We will merge it and update the gh-pages branch. Updating gh-pages branch is live instantly. Your contribution will be automatically added to the [credit](https://docs.96rocks.com/credits/) section once merged.
